# Widget-For-You
Playing with Widgets has never been more educational

9/11: Mostly fooled around with Prof. Madden's code to learn what it did (This was origionally undocutmented in the readme)
9/13: Added Spinners for color and sticker selection (this took longer than I thought)
9/15: Did some more Spinner research and implemented actual functionality for each selection. Enxt step, actual paint
9/16: Paint research is underway. Most of it is figuring out what each function does because a lot of the physical code is very well documented but missing the context of how it works. My code is sufficiently commented to reflect this.
9/18: More progress made in research and implementation but signifigant error found while trying to use a realtive layout in a linear layout (I thought this might be possible because you can have a nested linear layout). I might have to change the scope of this project if I can't get it by tommorow. 
9/19: This update is a little weird because a few of the changes are from updating android studio. The changes I made are very small and allows for everything to compile but the app stlil doesn't open. In class Friday, I will determine whether or not this project's scope need to be ajusted.
9/20: Unfortunatly after many nights of toil, I have to pull the plug on paint. With a heavy heart, I present to you... BACKGROUND SIMULATOR!!! Basically , I'm just going to use a bunch of shapes to make backgrounds. More features coming soon maybe?
9/23: After a weekend of being sick, I finally finished the first background. I will finsh up the whole app tomorrow and begin brainstorming the next app shortly.
9/24: Finished all backgrounds
