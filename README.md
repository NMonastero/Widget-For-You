# Widget-For-You
Playing with Widgets has never been more educational

9/11: Mostly fooled around with Prof. Madden's code to learn what it did (This was origionally undocutmented in the readme)
9/13: Added Spinners for color and sticker selection (this took longer than I thought)
9/15: Did some more Spinner research and implemented actual functionality for each selection. Enxt step, actual paint
9/16: Paint research is underway. Most of it is figuring out what each function does because a lot of the physical code is very well documented but missing the context of how it works. My code is sufficiently commented to reflect this.
